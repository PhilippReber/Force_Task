# Instructions for using the Force_Task in Python

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The "Force_Task.py" class file in the same directory as your Python script.

## Loading the Class
1. Open your Python script in your preferred code editor.
2. Import the "Force_Move_Task" class using the following command:

```python
from Force_Task import Force_Move_Task

3. You can now create an instance of the "Force_Move_Task" class and use its methods in your code.

Example:
```python
from Force_Task import Force_Move_Task

task = Force_Move_Task()
task.start_task()

This will create a new instance of the "Force_Move_Task" class and call its "start_task" method.
